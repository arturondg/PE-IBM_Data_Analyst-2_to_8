Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python is the sixth course of [IBM Data Analysis Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/947G6HG93HX8).  
This course introduces us to Relational Databases, and teaches us how to use SQL in conjunction with Pyhon.

### Agenda

1. Getting Started with SQL
2. Introduction to Relational Databases and Tables
3. Intermediate SQL
4. Accessing Databases using Python
5. Course Assignment

## Labs

As in previous documents, only laboratories considered relevant and documentable are included.
For this reason, only the fourth and fifth modules were added.
