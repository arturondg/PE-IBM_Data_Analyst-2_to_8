This is the fifth course of [IBM Data Analysis Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/947G6HG93HX8). And from now on, most labs will be stored in Jupyter Notebooks.  
This is because, the main language used is Python. In addition, I only uploaded labs that represented new knowledge to me  
or that seem important.

### Agenda

1. Python Basics
2. Python Data Structures
3. Python Programming Fundamentals
4. Working with Data in Python
5. APIs, and Data Collection

## Labs

All labs are in Jupyter Notebooks, and belong to fourth and fifth modules.
